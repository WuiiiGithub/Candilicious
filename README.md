### Vision
As you have come till here, I would like to share my vision for this project. I am a strong critique of the current day education system. Here's why:

- It doesn't encourage creativity.
- It doesn't encourage new perspectives.
- It makes smart students to be dumb. In simple words, even if human civilization has reached this far, I don't see (yet) new genious people who take intelectual position of old genious people.
- It forces students to byheart than learn.
- I don't see the concept of student freedom with respect to their own learning journey.
- We are thought obedience on the name of discipline.
- The examination system has so many loopholes.
- Teachers are forced to follow the curriculum and doesn't get much time with students.
- There is no grading for teachers based on the life outcomes of their students because of that teachings. (A huge work which is pending.)
- (Keeping in context of AI, Internet, Offline Tutors...etc.) Educational institutions are turning out to be just Certifying Organinations.
- Apart from all this, I also see huge amount of immoral practices giving birth. *(Refer the Concepts: Banality of Evil and Lucifer Effect.)*

So, I believe it's better to find a more efficient system for educating young minds and helping them grow. One of the most interesting things that caught my eye is how online facilities and recent technologies provided to the general public are gradually dismantling the traditional form of the education system. And I believe that its a very good thing. 

Having observed all this, I have a vision of creating more facilities for students to learn and grow. This is my baby steps in this journey. I am not sure how far I can go, but I will try my best. For me, its not about 'you' or 'me' its about the 'we'. By using the word 'we', I mean people who think and feel the same. It is very important to note that, if we really want to do something great for student community then we need to keep it accessible to student community. And let the things remain accessible to them. So, I am planning my contributions related to these in Open Source.

*In a short and a concluding line, visioning of a world where student is free in their learning journey.*

### Baby Steps
These are the baby steps I have took so far by creating this bot:
- People will join in VC and study.
- If they don't do any activity they will be kicked out.
- If they don't have good connection to neither share their screen nor do cam then they will be given a temporary exception (after checking their network).
- They will also have a bunch of commands so that they can have fun playing memes sound effects and meme songs in VC. 

### Ways of Contributing
- You can contribute to the codebase by submitting pull requests.
- You can help by reporting bugs or suggesting new features.
- You can help by spreading the word about Candilicious to your friends and communities.
- You can help by testing the bot and providing feedback.
- You can even help by engaging discussions in the community.
